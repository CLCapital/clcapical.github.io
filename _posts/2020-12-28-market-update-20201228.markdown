# General Market commentary
[![SPX]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2020-12-28/SPX-d.jpg)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2020-12-28/SPX-d.jpg)
Market gapped up and stayed up for the day. This shows the strength of the market we have. This advance is led by the large cap stocks as indicated in [12/16/2020's market update]({% post_url 2020-12-16-market-update-20201216 %}).
However if you mainly focus on growth stocks, we are seeing some weakness below the surface. Be careful if you are a growth investor!

# Quantative market model signal

1. Midterm trend: moderately bullish

2. Midterm risk: high

# Featured charts
[![AAPL]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2020-12-28/AAPL-d.jpg)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2020-12-28/AAPL-d.jpg)
The almighty AAPL is approaching to ATH again. If you are long AAPL, hold onto it is your best bet. However, the crazy optimism on Apple's electric car is a potential risk.
My best guess is AAPL will stall a bit here and continue higher into seasonally choppy January.
