# General Market commentary
[![SPX]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2020-12-30/SPX-d.jpg)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2020-12-30/SPX-d.jpg)
S&P 500 went inside today. The volume is light as year end approaching. The internal of the market is getting a little bit thinner as you can see below. If you are unfamiliar with $BPSPX indicator, please read [this document: StockCharts Bullish Percent Index
](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=index_symbols:bpi_symbols).

As you can see in the $SPX vs $BPSPX chart, the divergence is getting wider. This is another reason why we see the midterm risk is high.

# Quantative market model signal

## PDD
[![PDD]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2020-12-30/PDD-market-summary.jpg)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2020-12-30/PDD-market-summary.jpg)

As we highlighted in [yesterday's market update]({% post_url 2020-12-29-market-update-20201229 %}), PDD closed up with another +7.77% today.
This sustained buying proved our thesis that all the funds want China E-commerce exposure are under-allocated on PDD.
We called for 200 price target in the near term and it might get there soon.

## BIDU

CL Capital had a fun day with Baidu. BIDU broke out of a short consolidation and closed up +12.59% today and gained another 2% in after hours.
CL Capital entered BIDU 20201231C205 calls at 3. It hit 15 at close. That's +500% gain in one day.
We then entered 20210115C220/240 bull call spread as a safer play for [our private members]({% post_url 2020-12-22-clcapital-twitter-rules.20201222 %}).

Needless to say after an hour and half those call spreads went +100%. We alerted our members to sell half and make the rest a free bet to manage risk.

These call spreads are now a free bet and [theta](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/theta.asp#:~:text=The%20term%20theta%20refers%20to,time%20decay%20of%20an%20option.&text=Theta%20is%20generally%20expressed%20as,option%27s%20value%20declines%20every%20day.) neutral with 2 weeks to go. CL Capital believes this will be a great trade to wrap up 2020 and to start 2021 strong!

One final bonus for our patient readers: Remember to play what's moving. This is the best way to compound your capital rapidly.
The current theme in the market is clearly EV and China stocks :). As always, remember to manage your own risk!!!
