# [JMIA](https://group.jumia.com/) 
[![JMIA]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2020-12-22/JMIA-market-summary.jpg)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2020-12-22/JMIA-market-summary.jpg)

JMIA is the idea we brought up in [12/17/2020's stock ideas]({% post_url 2020-12-17-stock-ideas-20201217 %}).
It closed up +14.18% on the day. If you followed our idea then you should be smiling now.
Looks like it still wants higher prices. However, you need to manage your own risks. CL Capital will NOT manage your account for you.

# [VNET](https://www.21vianet.com/)
[![VNET]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2020-12-22/VNET-market-summary.jpg)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2020-12-22/VNET-market-summary.jpg)

VNET also comes from [12/17/2020's stock ideas]({% post_url 2020-12-17-stock-ideas-20201217 %}).
VNET was up nicely +6.5% in the early session but faded a bit and closed +3.43%. 
Both VNET and JMIA are able to provide our readers >10% profits in less than a week.
