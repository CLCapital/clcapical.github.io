Demoratic won the senate runoffs today. Market initially rallied due to eliminated runoffs uncertainty.
However it later retraced half of the gains due to this news: [Trump supporters storm Capitol](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/01/06/dc-protests-trump-rally-live-updates/).
As predicted in [yesterday's market analysis]({% post_url 2021-01-06-market-update-20210106 %}), renewable energy, infrastructure and cannabis EXPLODED!
For example, SPWR(renewable energy) closed +20%. URI(infrastructure) closed +9%. TLRY(cannabis) closed +13%.
Well positioned readers can secure some profits if you are playing short term speculation.

U.S. 10-year treasury note rose above 1% for the first time since last March's COVID crash.
The rise in bond yield indicates the market is indeed anticipating a big stimulus package following Democratic party sweep.
However, a 1% yield is a ridiculous return right now. In this current market condition, no retail investor should own treasuries.
A simple alternative is to park your sitting cash into some SPAC plays close to its floor price and sell it on merger news.
This way, your reward/risk ratio really only depends on how close you can buy those shares from their floor prices.
