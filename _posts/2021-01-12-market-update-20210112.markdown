# General Market commentary

S&P 500 is flat today. The market is catching a breath which is healthy.
The good news is all the growth stocks are absolutely on fireeeeee today!
We alerted XPEV in our private twitter this morning:

## GEX

[![GEX]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2021-01-12/GEX-d.jpg)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2021-01-12/GEX-d.jpg)
In [yesterday's market analysis]({% post_url 2021-01-11-market-update-20210111 %}), we discussed GEX could potentialliy limit market upside.
However, GEX is down a lot today. Remember, most of the faded GEX come from FANG+ stocks. This could signal a short term rally for mega-caps.
Again, remember this week is [OPEX week](https://www.marketwatch.com/optionscenter/calendar) and the market is expected to be volatile and choppy!!!
