# General Market commentary
[![SPX]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2021-01-07/SPX-d.jpg)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2021-01-07/SPX-d.jpg)

Followed by our Midterm trend upgrade in [yesterday's market analysis]({% post_url 2021-01-06-market-update-20210106 %}), the market closed at ATH today.
It looks like a melt up here confirmed by market internals. As you can see in NAA50R, the market breadth hit a recent high of 84.42%.
This means 84.42% of NASDAQ issues are trading above their 50 day moving averages.
This is a healthy sign. Shall the market pulls back, the dips should be buyable.

# Quantative market model signal

1. Midterm trend: bullish (upgraded from neutral)

2. Midterm risk: neutral (downgraded from high)

[![BTCUSD]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2021-01-07/BTCUSD-d.jpg)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2021-01-07/BTCUSD-d.jpg)
Bitcoin hit 40K today! It only took BTC less than a month to gain 100% following an ATH breakout at $20,000.
However, one can clearly see the rate of advance is accelerating - this is a sign of euphoria and usually leads to exhaustion and short term climatic tops.
But make no mistake, CL Capital is VERY BULLISH on BTC in the long run given the risk of the fiat currency system.
For long term investors, any major dips should be buyable. But DO NOT overweight cryptos in your portfolio unless you REALLY know what you are doing.
CL Capital's view on cryptos is a PUT/insurance against the current financial system. You have to buy insurance, but you probably don't need a LOT of it.
Of course for crypto believers with STRONG conviction, the strategy has never changed - HODL!
