A shakeout day for the market as the market gapped down, dove for a few hours then ripped right back and managed to get a decent close. 
However one cannot simply ignore the elevated volatility. We are going to take a more cautious approach to the market due to elevated volatility and bullish sentiment.

# Quantative market model signal
1. Midterm trend: moderately bullish(downgraded from bullish)
2. Midterm risk: high(downgraded from neutral)

A fun day with [EDIT](https://www.editasmedicine.com/). Here's the headline: [Editas surges 50% as ARK founder Cathie Wood sees genomic stocks driving returns for the next 5 years](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/editas-stock-price-ark-cathie-wood-genomic-stocks-driving-returns-2020-12-1029911942). CLCapital entered EDIT around 68 and it exploded to 95 in less than a day. That's an astonishing 40% gain in less than 3 hours. We were able to capture majority of the explosion and scaled out on the way up. Being such a rocket, we'd like to stick with EDIT for a little bit longer. That's right - we still have a tranch in it. However, CL Capital 100% won't consider the stock here if it's a fresh buy as it's soooooo extended. EDIT is a GREAT example of how you can compound your capital rapidly by catching rocket stocks.
Don't get me wrong - this is absolutely NOT a show off but rather a demonstration of the inefficiency of the market and how you can profit from it.
