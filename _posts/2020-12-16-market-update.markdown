The S&P 500 index stalled a little bit near ATH as expected. The overall action is healthy. FOMC reaction is pretty bullish.
Key take aways:
1. FED will keep its accomodative stance of monetary policy. This is THE key for mid to long term bullish thesis.
2. FED will keep the FED funds rate near 0 for the foreseeable future.
3. FED will continue QE by at least $80B/month for treasuries and $40B/month for MBS.

# Quantative market model signal
1. Midterm trend: moderately bullish
2. Midterm risk: neutral

## NYFANG:SPX

The mighty FANG stocks has been lagging lately. The ratio of NYFANG:SPX broke out of an uptrending channel at the beginning of November.
However these large caps are catching up now. Don't get me wrong - AAPL/MSFT/AMZN/GOOG/FB/NFLX are still good, but I bet you won't see those 5x-10x moves in the next few years.
To outperform the market, you'd better to rotate your money to some hotter industries like solar I mentioned yesterday. But the risk is higher too.
