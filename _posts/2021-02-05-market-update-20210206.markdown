S&P 500 closed at ATH this week again!
Last week's dip was proved to be a great dip buying opportunity for long term investors as indicated in [last week's market analysis]({% post_url 2021-01-27-market-update-20210127 %}).

The small caps have been constantly outperforming the general market for a while now. Small caps are often overlooked by investors as they are not well-known names.
But always remember, the biggest gains ALWAYS come from stocks NOT in spotlights!

Checkout the [YTD performance in Russell 2000](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/indices/russell/russell2000?viewName=performance&orderBy=percentChangeYtd&orderDir=desc)!
Most of these names are NOT investors' favorites. It certainly pays to do a treasure hunt in the small caps world! A few names worth noticing are listed below:

| theme | stockss to consider |
|---|---|
| electric vehicle | WKHS, FCEL, PLUG |
| 3d printing | DDD, XONE, SSYS, NNDM |
| vaccine | NVAX |
| oncology | GRTS, OCX, ZIOP |
| crypto | OSTK, SI, MSTR |
