Jumia is an e-commerce company in Africa. You can consider it as the Amazon of Africa. 
This stock is getting a lot of love recently and you can clearly see the hot demand on e-commerce/COVID names.
To compound you capital rapidly, you need to participate in hyped/high octane names like JMIA with aggress risk management.
Since September low JMIA experienced a jaw-dropping 500% advance and it looks it still wants to go higher.
The stock needs to take out 41 level to continue moving higher. If the stock doesn't perform as expected, limit your loss to 10% of your cost.

21Vianet operates Microsoft Azure/Office products in China. It also has an expanding data center business. VNET's most recent earning smashed analysts' estimates.
It lost money 6 quarters in a row and turned around the situation on the current report. Today it broke out of a consolidation held back by [Blackrock's ADS conversion news](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/21vianet-announces-us-150-million-120235706.html). This stock should see higher prices from here. If the stock doesn't perform as expected, limit your loss to 10% of your cost.
