# General Market commentary

The S&P 500 index experienced choppy action on the [quad-witching day](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-will-quad-witching-mean-for-the-stock-market-trade-on-friday-11600371672) as expected. 
We are seeing some stocks breaking out of bases but also some reversals. The overall tape is mixed.

# Quantative market model signal
1. Midterm trend: bullish
2. Midterm risk: neutral(upgraded from high)

# Featured chart
## GEX

GEX has came down quiet a bit as expected. This de-leverages option market maker's exposure, and therefore we upgraded Midterm risk in Quantative market model signal from high to neutral.
